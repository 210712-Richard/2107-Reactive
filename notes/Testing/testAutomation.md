# Test Automation

The practice of scripting out end to end and integration tests that would otherwise require manual testing.

Really important to have good DevOps, because otherwise you sit and wait for your manual testers (a job no one actually wants) to get feedback on whether your application works. Or you're manually testing your application. With good Automation testing, you don't need to do either of those things (as often).

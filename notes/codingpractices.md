# Good Practices
## Watch Words
* Readability: Your code should be easy for another (and you) to understand
  * Conventions help other people read your code.
* Scalability
* Extensibility
* Reusability
* Maintainability
## Definitions
* *Explicit*: Stated visibly. Physically exists within the code.
* *Implicit*: Implied. Not stated. Exists in the code without being written.

## Naming Conventions
### Java
* Packages: reverse.domain.name
  * ex. com.revature.automobile
* Classes: PascalCase
  * ex. FourLiterEngine
* Methods and Variables: camelCase
  * ex. myConnection
* Constants: UPPER_CASE
  * ex. BREATHABLE_AIR

# JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?

High-level programming language. It is a scripting language. It is an interpreted or just-in-time compiled language. It is a multiparadigm language.

JavaScript is the jack of all trades. JavaScript is a master of none.

**interpreted**: not compiled. It is run without being rewritten to machine code. Code is executed as it is read.

**just-in-time compiled**: Compiled just before it is run, usually not rewritten as machine code, just rewritten to be easier to interpret.

**ASIDE**: Compiled languages we create a deliverable artifact that will be executed by the target. In JIT compilation, we deliver the code itself and the target environment compiles and then runs it.
---
**NOTE**: Some people (who are wrong) will insist (incorrectly) that Java is an interpreted language. This is at best a misunderstanding of the term and at worst a misrepresentation of the process.

**high-level code**: Code that reads like a human language.

**low-level code**: code that is hard for humans to read but very easy for machines to read. ex. Assembly

**scripting language**: a programming language that is intended to automate tasks easily with minimal set-up.

**multi-paradigm**: A programming language that focuses on multiple programming paradigms.

Object Oriented, Functional, Event-driven, Procedural

* OOP: When I have a problem, I model that problem as an object or objects, then I use that object's state and behavior to solve the problem. I manipulate objects to solve problems.
* Functional: When I have a problem, I create functions that, when called, will solve the problem.
* Event-driven: When I have a problem, I create an even that, when triggered, will solve the problem.

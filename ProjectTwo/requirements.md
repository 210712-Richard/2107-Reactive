# Project Two

Monday: Project Proposal - A paragraph describing what your project is, what type of users (2+) it deals with, and what tasks those users are able to perform.

Once I have approved your project proposal, you will need to submit your user stories to me, and once I have signed off on those, you may begin coding.
